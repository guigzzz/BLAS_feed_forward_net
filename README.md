# C-neural-net

C++ implementation of a fast-forward algorithm for a neural network.
This implementation uses OpenBLAS and Boost.SIMD
Also contains some routines that are compatible with the FANN data structures, as well as some other routines that use FANN network files converted to binary for input (for speed)
